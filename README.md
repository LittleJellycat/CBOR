## Kotlin CBOR Exercise

This implementation of CBOR currently correctly encodes and decodes primitives (Int/Long, Float/Double, String, Enum, Boolean, null).

Encoding of arrays and maps works also fine, but decoding is not supported yet.

- [X] Encoding + decoding primitives
- [X] Encoding complex structures
- [ ] Decoding complex structures
- [ ] Code clean-up + simplification
